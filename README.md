# Content-Cacher
==========
A content scraper for offline social media viewing.

Given some playlist, subreddit, blog, channel, or some other content feed, this program will download everything
for offline viewing. This would allow anyone to get around inconsistent internet connections, or no internet connection.

Being built in C#, the project is in very early stages and is nowhere near even basic functionality.

If there is no module for downloading the content optimally, the cacher will download the entire web-page instead.
